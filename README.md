# safe-agent-treasury

Multi-sig treasury management for autonomous AI agents using [Safe Smart Account](https://safe.global) on Base.

Deploy a Safe with AllowanceModule spending limits, multi-sig transaction proposals, and automatic hot wallet refill. On-chain enforcement -- the blockchain is the guardrail, not software.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install

# 1. Deploy Safe (1-of-2 with your wallet + agent hot wallet)
node scripts/agent-treasury-deploy.mjs --owner 0xYourWalletAddress

# 2. Configure AllowanceModule + spending limits
#    (set SAFE_ADDRESS in ~/morpheus/.env first)
node scripts/agent-treasury-configure.mjs

# 3. Move funds to Safe, then raise threshold
node scripts/agent-treasury-propose.mjs threshold --value 2

# 4. Install auto-refill daemon (every 6 hours)
bash scripts/install.sh
```
